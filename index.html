        <h1 id="titre">Electric cars: a revolutionary change?</h1>

        <p>There can be no doubt today that global warming is one of the most pressing crises we face. Faced with the urgent need to act, targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are multiplying, both nationally and internationally. The European Union has decided to ban the sale of new combustion-powered cars by 2035. Electric cars are emerging as an essential alternative to combustion-powered vehicles, enabling cities to achieve their goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, by reducing their dependence on fossil fuels and improving air quality in these cities.
        </p>
        <p>This article analyzes the trend in the number of electric vehicles between 2022 and 2024 in the Rhône département, a striking example. It compares this trend with the total vehicle fleet, and discusses the prospects for achieving the targets set for 2030. 
         <br>   But first, what are the objectives for 2030? The main objective is to have 15 million electric vehicles by 2030, in line with the strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the impact of motor cars. Let's see if we can achieve this goal, using data collected for the Rhône département over the last two years.
            
        </p>


        <p>
            In 2022, the number of electric cars in the Rhône departement will be 28,646, rising to 40,832 in 2023 and 57,122 in 2024. We can see that in two years, there has been an increase of 99.4%. However, the number of others vehicles in the region has increased less, from 1.7 million in 2022 to 1.74 million in 2024. That's means that electric vehicles are making an impact on the market.
            </p>

            <div id="bullesContainer"></div>

        <p>To better understand the distribution of vehicles in the region, we have calculated averages and medians.
            <br> - In 2022, the average number of electric vehicles per commune was 103, and the average number of total vehicles (all categories) was 6138. 
            <br> - By 2024, these averages had risen to 206 and 6306
            <br>The median (the mid-point of the data) tells us something different. In 2022, the median for electric vehicles was 32, and in 2024 it was 62. This means that 50% of communes had more than 62 electric vehicles in 2024, indicating an increasingly even distribution across the department.
        </p>
        <P>
            The difference between the mean and the median shows that a few densely populated communes are pulling the mean upwards, while the median gives a more realistic idea of the distribution of electric vehicles in the majority of communes.
            </P>
        <p>With the quartile, we can divide communes into four equal groups according to the number of vehicles. For example, for electric vehicles in 2024, we can see that :
            <br>- The first quartile is 20 (25% of communes have fewer than 20 electric vehicles),
            <br>- The median (second quartile) is 62,
            <br> - The third quartile is 189 (25% of communes have more than 189 electric vehicles).
            <br> So there's a great deal of diversity in the departement, with some communes already owning electric
            vehicles long before that.

    <button id="filterButtonMin">Afficher les communes avec le moins de bornes</button>    <div id="barresContainer"></div>
    <button id="showAllButton">Afficher toutes les communes</button>

    <p>
        Another important indicator is the standard deviation, which measures the dispersion of the data. In 2022, the standard deviation for electric vehicles was 222, whereas in 2024, it was 431.
        This increase means that the gap between municipalities with few electric vehicles and those with many is widening. This is certainly due to the fact that some communes have seen a more rapid development of recharging infrastructures, and therefore an adoption of these new vehicles that follows this change, while other communes, probably more rural, remain behind
        </p>

   <p>As the gap between communes with few electric vehicles and those with many increases, it is also important to examine the relationship between charging infrastructure and electric vehicle adoption.
   <br> A key aspect of our study concerns the relationship between the number of charging stations and the adoption of electric vehicles in the department. Calculating a correlation coefficient of 0.39, we observed a moderate positive correlation: the more charging stations a commune has, the more electric vehicles it tends to have. However, this correlation is not very strong, indicating that other factors, such as local policies or financial incentives, also influence this adoption.
   <br>This result underlines the importance of an adequate charging infrastructure to encourage the use of electric vehicles, but it is equally crucial to consider other measures to maximize this transition. It is therefore vital to continue investing in the development of charging stations, particularly in rural areas, to ensure an equitable transition to electric mobility throughout the department.
</p>

<p>The data that we have examined shows just how impressive the adoption of electric vehicles in the Rhône. However, this transition is not uniform. Some communes are making a great evolution, while others seem to be taking a little longer to adapt. By analyzing the correlation coefficient, we find a moderate positive relationship between the number of charging stations that that have been put in place and the number of electric vehicles. This means that improving the charging infrastructure seems to encourage more people to opt for electric vehicles. That said, it is important to note that this relationship is not very strong, suggesting that other elements, such as public awareness or economic incentives, also play a crucial role.</p>

<p>Reaching the target of 15 million electric vehicles in France by 2030 is an ambitious challenge, but this departments is showing that a transition is possible! For this to happen, it is important to continue developing charging infrastructures, especially in rural areas, in order to reduce disparities and make electromobility accessible to all. This change requires a collective commitment, both at political level and in the communities, to ensure that every commune can enjoy the benefits of sustainable mobility.</p>
